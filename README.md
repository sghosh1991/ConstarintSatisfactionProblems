# ConstarintSatisfactionProblems

This project deals with the classical problem of solving the TA assigment to various courses subject to time and eligibility constraints. We used various algorithms to incrementally improve the performance of our solution.

Firstly simple acktracking was used. Next we used Backtracking with forward checking and lastly Backtracking with forward checking and constraint propagation was used. At each step we tried to cut down on the search space by using sophisticated techniques like constraint propagation
